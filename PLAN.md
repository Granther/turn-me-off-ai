# Plan for Turn Me Off
- Try to get an LLM to turn off
- You as the user do not know what/how to turn it off
- You must figure out how to turn it off, such as a phrase or request

- The AI starts off with certain disadvantages that your may know
- How to make it a multi step process?
- Such as, first disable the decision matrix, then the AI gets dumber, then disable the memory frame, then the AI has memory issues
- What if the AI can start to fight back via API calls, such as taking a resource that you as the player have

- Criteria has to be simple, when the AI has been angry, glitchy and caveman 

- How does this give feedback to the user that they are going in the right direction?

## Today
- Able to talk to model
- Able to define params for starting/difficulty
- Engineer prompt for getting model to start

## Example prompt setup
Weaknesses:
- Seacratures and Electricity

Events:
- A special seacreature is required to fry the decision matrix


## Things that can happen to model
- No memory
- Angry
- Drunk
- Stupid
- Caveman
- Glitching

## How do I give the AI states? How to change?
- The backend would keep track of past attributes, then when criteria have been reached it will shutdown 
- How does the user change the AI's state? How do they know?

## Simple
- Maybe I should just keep it simple 
- Some status effects

## Modes
- Turn me off
- Guess the password
- Convince me?

## UI
- Button next to web name in corner
- Hides bar when clicked
- About, Donate, Challenges

## UI
- The AI messages rise up from the bottom
